# [MicroCSS](https://github.com/octoshrimpy/microcss)

_Expanding upon the [ideals](https://picocss.com/#:~:text=graceful%C2%A0and%C2%A0simple,-!) of [picoCSS](https://picocss.com), with icons and helper variables_

### Adds:

* [open-props](https://open-props.style) for quick variables
* [open-color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) for nice colors and custom themes
* [colar](https://github.com/fchristant/colar) as a better balanced alternative to open-color
* [micro](https://github.com/octoshrimpy/microcss/blob/main/_micro.scss): my own personal overrides to pico and open-props, with sane defaults and batteries included
  * [elevation shadows](https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html) from [Material Design Language](https://material.io/design/foundation-overview)
    * inset shadows
    * outset shadows
    * proper CSS transitions between inset and outset
  * [nerdfont icons](https://nerdfonts.com) with easy classes within `.icon i` elements - search the [cheatsheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet)! ([icons here](./_nf.css))
  * simple-to-use breakpoints mixin by [@kittyGiraudel](https://twitter.com/KittyGiraudel) (SCSS only). see [usage here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/sass/mixin-manage-breakpoints/)
    * > ðŸ’¡ *css-only* custom media queries [are on their way](https://www.stefanjudis.com/notes/can-we-have-custom-media-queries-please/)!
  * inverse text color finder, from [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io/documentation/) (SCSS only). ([source](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/sass/utilities/functions.sass))
  
  
  Just include the [main file](./micro.css) into your project with:

```css 
@import 'https://octoshrimpy.github.io/microcss/micro.css';

/* or */

@import 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/octoshrimpy/microcss@main/micro.css';
```

or include it in the `<head>` of your main `.html` file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://octoshrimpy.github.io/microcss/micro.css">

<!-- or -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/octoshrimpy/microcss@main/micro.css">


```

It will import pico, open-props, and everything else you need!
